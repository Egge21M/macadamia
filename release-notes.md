This build of macadamia containes **minor UI improvements**:

The four main buttons have been consolidated into two, which you can either tap or touch-drag (for those shooting ecash from the hip ðŸ¤ ).
Further, views that are no longer needed after a successful operation will auto-dismiss after 1 second.

As always, thanks for testing **macadamia**!
