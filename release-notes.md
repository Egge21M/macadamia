This build of macadamia introduces **animated QR codes**!

Animated QR codes let you transmit Cashu tokens of any size.

The wallet will automatically choose animated QR when the token size is above a certain number of characters (or approximately 2 proofs).
Compatibility with other wallets that support animated QR may not be perfect in the beginning, but will improve quickly.
This is still a work in progress.
