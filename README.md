# macadamia for iOS

This is __macadamia__, a native iOS client for [cashu](https://github.com/cashubtc).
cashu is a Chaumian eCash system designed for near perfect privacy.

macadamia support standard cashu operations such as:
- __Minting__ of tokens
- __Sending__ and 
- __Receiving__
- __Melting__ tokens (using them to pay a Lightning Network invoice) 
- Restoring your wallet balance using a 12 word mnemonic __seed phrase backup__

Additionally, macadamia supports sending and receiving/redeeming tokens sent over the __Nostr__ protocol!
